# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) challenges.

I couldn't think of a new language to try this year, so [I made my own](https://github.com/eero-lehtinen/eerolang) just for the purpose of completing advent of code this year.

## How to run

Install the language

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/eero-lehtinen/eerolang
```

Download the challenge input to `input.txt`.

Run

```sh
eerolang day1/part2.eel
```
